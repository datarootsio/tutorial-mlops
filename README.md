# MLOps workshop

"MLOps is a set of practices that aims to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently." - [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLOps)

At datartoots we've been pioneers of the **MLOps** methodology since the very beginning. For us MLOps means being able to identify all the **business** challenges, **deliver** the best solution quickly and efficiently, and **monitor** the project's evolution over time.

To promote MLOps best practices we have run a workshop to KU Leuven university students. In this repository you can find the three different notebooks  (a tutorial, an exercise and exercise solutions) which we created for the MLOps workshop. The tutorial gives a gentle introduction to three popular frameworks for MLOps: [DVC](https://dvc.org/), [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) and [Pycaret](https://pycaret.org/). It will show you how to version your data using DVC, track your experiments using MLFlow and doing autoML using Pycaret. Afterwards you can practice your newly acquired knowledge by completing the exercise notebook. 

## Getting started 
The notebooks are created in Google Colab :partying_face: and can easily be accessed by clicking these links:
